          Events
        </h1>
        <p>
          When you create a rule in PushStateTree, this rule will trigger
          events when it's inside a router or another rule, those events
          create a flow where you can use execute callbacks.
        </p>
        <p>
          The initial rule flow is:
          <span class="label label-primary">enter</span> >
          <span class="label label-info">change</span> >
          <span class="label label-danger">leave</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the initial flow happen the flows will be always:
          <span class="label label-danger">leave</span> >
          <span class="label label-primary">enter</span> >
          <span class="label label-info">change</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The full list of events in call priority:
          <span class="label label-warning">any</span> [
          <span class="label label-danger">leave</span> >
          <span class="label label-success">match</span> (
          <span class="label label-primary">enter</span> >
          <span class="label label-info">change</span> ) ].
        </p>
        <h2>enter</h2>
        <p>
          Called when you match a rule once it wasn't triggered before.
        </p>
        <h2>change</h2>
        <p>
          Called if the rule match, but already executed enter.
        </p>
        <h2>leave</h2>
        <p>
          If the previous match this rule but the current doesn't, leave
          will be called.
        </p>
        <h2>match</h2>
        <p>
          Called if enter or change are called.<br>
          * Match event is called on every dispatch, even if the URL doesn't change.
        </p>
        <p>
          Match does the same kind of callback other routers usually do, like
          Backbone and SailsJS.
        </p>
        <h2>any</h2>
        <p>
          Called on any event.
