        </h1>
        <p>
          Rules are objects that contain a regular expression to match the URL, it might be directly related to the
          router object or being child of another rule.
        </p>
        <p>
          When a URL change or is manually triggered, the rules are executed in order to check all changes that will
          occur on the change of the current URL. Those changes create a queue of events to be executed that respect
          the event priority order.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <code>rule</code> instance is also a <code>HTMLElement</code>, witch means that it will have the same
          structure, methods and properties of a <code>HTMLElement</code>, using browser native event listeners,
          allowing be appended into other elements or have elements inside it.
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-html"><xmp><pushstatetree-rule id="myRuleID" rule="/regular_expression/">
  <pushstatetree-rule id="myParentRule" rule="/regular_expression/" parentGroup="1">
  </pushstatetree-rule>
</pushstatetree-rule></xmp></pre>
        <p>
          Rules also contains all trigger methods from the <code>router</code> instance where they're in.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's possible to create rules from router instances, after create the rule, you must append it inside a router
          or another rule to it became enabled, example:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-js"><code>var pushStateTree = new PushStateTree();

// Create a Rule element
var myRuleELement = pushStateTree.createRule({
  id: 'myFirstRule',
  rule: /.+/
});

// Append to pushStateTree to enable
pushStateTree.appendChild(myRuleElement);</code></pre>
        <p>
          To disable a rule, you need to remove it from the router or the other rule where it is, if you remove a rule
          that contains children rules, all the children rules will also be disabled.
        </p>
          <pre class="prettyprint lang-js"><code>// Remove from pushStateTree to disable
pushStateTree.removeChild(myRuleElement);</code></pre>

        </h2>
        <p>
          You can define the properties passing a literal object with options to the method <code>createRule</code> from
          the router instance, or you can set those properties in the rule instance after it's created.
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-js"><code>var pushStateTree = new PushStateTree();

// Create a empty Rule element
var myRuleELement = pushStateTree.createRule();

// Set properties:
myRuleELement.id = 'myFirstRule';
myRuleELement.rule: /.+/;

// Append to pushStateTree to enable
pushStateTree.appendChild(myRuleElement);</code></pre>
        <h3 id="rule-property-rule">
          rule = {Regular Expression}

        </h3>
        <p>
          This property must contain a Regular Expression that will evaluate the rule element. The context used to match
          will depend on the parent element.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the parent element is a <code>Router</code> the content will be the full URL not including the
          <code>basePath</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the parent element is a <code>Rule</code> the content will be the partial URL used by the parent rule, or
          if the property <code>parentGroup</code> is set, it will use the maching group from the parent rule.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the next example, each string representing the match will be value of a group starting from 0.
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-js"><code>// Testing address: http://localhost/abc:def/
myRuleElement1.rule = /.+/;          // "abc:def/"
myRuleElement2.rule = /abc:(.*)\//;  // "abc:def/", "def"
myRuleElement3.rule = /(.+):(.+)\//; // "abc:def/", "abc", "def"
myRuleElement4.rule = /(test)/;      // not match

// Testing address: http://localhost/abc:/
myRuleElement1.rule = /.+/;          // "abc:/"
myRuleElement2.rule = /abc:(.*)\//;  // "abc:/", ""
myRuleElement3.rule = /(.+):(.+)\//; // not match
myRuleElement4.rule = /(test)/;      // not match

// Testing address: http://localhost/test/
myRuleElement1.rule = /.+/;          // "test/"
myRuleElement2.rule = /abc:(.*)\//;  // not match
myRuleElement3.rule = /(.+):(.+)\//; // not match
myRuleElement4.rule = /(test)\//;    // "test/", "test"</code></pre>
        <p>
          To match anything you need to add the rule <code>/.*/</code> and it will match anything, this rule is useful
          when you want to track events on everypage, like using Google Analytics in your Single Page Application.
        </p>

        <p>
          It only applies if the <code>rule</code> is children of another <code>rule</code>, and it will match with the
          group in the parent rule regular expression.
        </p>
        <p>
          By default <code>parentGroup</code> is <code>0</code>, witch means it will match the full string in the parent
          rule, but you can change this value to one that match the Regular Expression group of the parent rule.
        </p>

          If you're not very familiar with Regular Expressions, <a href="https://regex101.com/#javascript"
                                                                   target="_blank">https://regex101.com/#javascript</a>
          is a great tool to test your expressions, so copy the part of URL that you want to match, and others that you
          don't want match, and create your rule, them you'll be ready to use-it.
        </p>
        <p>
          With PushStateTree you can create a tree with as many levels you need for your project. You can add the
          rules on fly, even children one's. So you can load entry points of your application with logic data relative
          to the partial being rendered by your SPA, them you can load the other entry points with your own strategy.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Pre-cache strategy</strong>: Render the current entry point and start loading other entry points in the background.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>On-fly strategy</strong>: It loads the current URL, if the user click in a URL that is out of the current rule, it
              will download the entry point package, apply the logic and trigger the route.
            </li>
          </ul>
          Those are two examples that you can implement in your SPA using PushStateTree. A good way to archive great
          results it's to adopt <a href="https://webpack.github.io/" target="_blank">Webpack Module Bundler</a> to pack
          your bundle in entry points.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you set a <code>parentGroup</code> you can have as many as siblings watching the same group or
          different groups. It's a good practice to have one instance to watch a group and every rule that apply to such
          group be children of the rule.
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-html"><xmp><pushstatetree-rule id="myRule" rule="/page/(.*)/">
  <pushstatetree-rule id="subpageRule" rule="/(subpageA|subpageB)\/(.*)/" parentGroup="1">
    <pushstatetree-rule id="numberRule" rule="/([0-9]*)/" parentGroup="2">

  <pushstatetree-rule id="helpPluginB" rule="/(.+)/" parentGroup="1">

  </pushstatetree-rule>
</pushstatetree-rule></xmp></pre>
        <p>
          In the example above, the <code>helpPluginA</code> is same as <code>helpPluginB</code>, because the first one
          is inside the <code>subpageRule</code> and it will get <code>parentGroup="0"</code> as default, what includes
          the text that isn't in the group 1.
        </p>
        <p>
          The instance <code>helpPluginA</code> doesn't include the full URL because it's parent is listening for a
          group of <code>myRule</code> instance, by default it children will have access to the same match string if
          the <code>parentGroup</code> property is missing.

          Events
          <a href="rule-events" class="anchorjs-link"><span class="anchorjs-icon"></span></a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          When you create a rule in PushStateTree, this rule will trigger
          events when it's inside a router or another rule, those events
          create a flow where you can use execute callbacks.
        </p>
        <p>
          The initial rule flow is:
          <span class="label label-primary">enter</span> >
          <span class="label label-info">change</span> >
          <span class="label label-danger">leave</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the initial flow happen the flows will be always:
          <span class="label label-danger">leave</span> >
          <span class="label label-primary">enter</span> >
          <span class="label label-info">change</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The full list of events in call priority:
          <span class="label label-warning">update</span> [
          <span class="label label-danger">leave</span> >
          <span class="label label-success">match</span> (
          <span class="label label-primary">enter</span> >
          <span class="label label-info">change</span> ) ].
        </p>
        <h3 id="rule-event-enter">
          enter

        </h3>
        <p>
          Called when you match a rule once it wasn't triggered before.
        </p>
        <p>
          This event is good to append elements on DOM, children rules can rely that parent enter are executed in order
          before children event is triggered, this way you can compose your elements in the DOM knowing that they're
          ready to be used.
        </p>

          * Match event is called on every dispatch, even if the URL doesn't change.
        </p>
        <p>
          Match does the same kind of callback other routers usually do, like
          Backbone and SailsJS.

          The rules contain all <code>HTMLElement</code> methods, to add events you can use native methods like
